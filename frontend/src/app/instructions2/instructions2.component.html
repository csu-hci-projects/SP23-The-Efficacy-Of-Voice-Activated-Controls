			You will notice the game interface has changed slightly. The game will now be played by using your microphone
			described in the beginning of the experiment. Please reduce background noise and be sure to speak audibly while
			articulating as best as possible to avoid error. You will press start just as you did in the first step, except
			now you will have to press record and say the commands "<b>one</b>", "<b>two</b>", "<b>three</b>", or
			"<b>four</b>". If no speech is detected, your browser will alert you and nothing will be registered. All you have
			to do is press record and try again.
		</p>
		<p>
			This test is performed by voice input and is shown below. After the sequence has finished playing, please press
			the record button before speaking.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>NOTE:</b> the sequence will play <b>immiediately</b> after pressing start. Make sure you're prepared to
			memorize!

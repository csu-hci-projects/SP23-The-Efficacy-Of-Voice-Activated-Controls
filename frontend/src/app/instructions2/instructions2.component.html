			You will notice the game interface has changed slightly. The game will now be played by using your microphone
			described in the beginning of the experiment. Please reduce background noise and be sure to speak audibly while
			articulating as best as possible to avoid error. If no speech is detected, your browser will alert you and nothing
			will be registered. You will press start just as you did in the first step, except now you will have to press
			record and say the commands "<b>green</b>", "<b>red</b>", "<b>yellow</b>", or "<b>blue</b>"
		</p>
		<p>
			This test is performed by voice input and is shown below. After the sequence has finished playing, please press
			the record button before speaking.
		</p>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b> the sequence will play <b>immiediately</b> after pressing start. Make sure you're prepared!</p>
